from showroom import Showroom

"""

Note: If you are starting your Part 2 assignment from here, it is strongly recommended that you complete your tasks at
 sports_car.py and showroom.py files before continuing...

In the main function do the following (you can create separate functions for these tasks as you see fit and call them
in the main function). 

1. Instantiate the Showroom class and call the populate_cars method. 

2. Add the following car to the cars list of the showroom instance:

{
    brand: "Bentley"
    model: "Continental GT"
    car_type: CarType.COUPE
    fuel_capacity: 30
    milege: 20
}

3. Remove all the cars of type, CarType.HATCHBACK from the showroom cars list.

4. Call the dump_car_list method and write out the current cars list to the file.

5. Implement a function to read the car_names.txt which contains the names of required cars
 (eg: Bentley Continental GT) and return a list of boolean values stating whether the car
  is in the showroom or not. Your search algorithm should be implemented in a scalable and efficient manner. 


That is all. You have completed the test.
